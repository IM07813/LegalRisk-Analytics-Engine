## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-time Document Monitoring**: Automatically detects and processes new legal documents in specified directories
- **Advanced Risk Analysis**: Multi-factor risk assessment using sentiment analysis and keyword detection
- **Concurrent Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple documents simultaneously using thread pools
- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Prevents redundant processing using document hashing
- **Configurable Risk Weights**: Customizable risk assessment parameters for different legal contexts
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates markdown reports with risk scores, key findings, and actionable insights
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database integration for historical analysis and document tracking
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fault tolerance mechanisms

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Document Processing Pipeline**:
  - File system monitoring using Watchdog
  - Document sectioning and analysis
  - Concurrent processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
  - Risk score calculation and categorization

- **Analysis Components**:
  - Sentiment analysis using HuggingFace's FinBERT model
  - Keyword detection with configurable risk weights
  - Section-level and document-level risk assessment

- **Storage & Reporting**:
  - SQLite database for document tracking
  - Thread-safe database operations
  - Markdown report generation
  - Comprehensive logging system

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- HuggingFace API token for sentiment analysis
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legalsentry-pro.git
cd legalsentry-pro
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a configuration file (`config.yaml`):
```yaml
api_token: 'your-huggingface-api-token'
watch_dir: './docs'
output_dir: './reports'
db_path: 'legal_analyses.db'
max_workers: 4
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Start the monitoring system:
```bash
python legal_automation.py
```

2. Place legal documents in the watch directory (`./docs` by default)

3. Monitor the output directory (`./reports`) for generated analysis reports

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system can be customized through the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
risk_weights:
  legal: 1.5
  financial: 1.4
  reputation: 1.3
  operational: 1.2

risk_thresholds:
  high: 0.7
  medium: 0.4

max_retries: 5
request_timeout: 30
```

## 📊 Output Format

Analysis reports include:
- Overall risk score and category
- Key findings from document sections
- Identified risk factors
- Analysis summary statistics
- Section-by-section breakdown

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API tokens should be stored securely
- Document access permissions should be properly configured
- Regular backup of the SQLite database is recommended
- Monitor system logs for potential issues
