  - Comprehensive logging system
  - Configurable processing parameters
  - Fault-tolerant operation

- Detailed Reporting
  - Risk score calculation and categorization
  - Key findings identification
  - Risk factor analysis
  - Markdown report generation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. Document Processing Pipeline
   - File system monitoring with Watchdog
   - Concurrent processing using ThreadPoolExecutor
   - Document sectioning and analysis
   - Risk score computation

2. Analysis Engine
   - Integration with HuggingFace's FinBERT model
   - Configurable keyword detection system
   - Multi-level risk assessment
   - Sentiment analysis processing

3. Data Management
   - SQLite database integration
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Document hash tracking
   - Historical analysis storage

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- HuggingFace API token
- Required packages:
  - watchdog
  - requests
  - pyyaml
  - sqlite3

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/IM07813/LegalRisk-Analytics-Engine.git
cd LegalRisk-Analytics-Engine

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure application
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings
```

## Configuration

Example configuration (config.yaml):
```yaml
# Legal Automation System Configuration
api_token: "hf-token"  # Get this from huggingface.co
watch_dir: "./input"  # Directory to monitor for new files
output_dir: "./output"  # Directory for analysis reports
log_level: "DEBUG"


```

## Usage

1. Start the analysis engine:
```bash
python3 legal_automation.py
```

2. System will automatically:
   - Monitor specified directory for new documents
   - Process documents using configured parameters
   - Generate risk analysis reports
   - Store results in database

## Risk Analysis Output

Analysis reports include:
- Document risk score (0-1 scale)
- Risk categorization (High/Medium/Low)
- Section-by-section analysis
- Key findings and risk factors
- Processing statistics

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control
   - Secure API token storage
   - Proper file permissions
   - Database access controls

2. Data Protection
   - Regular database backups
   - Document hash verification
   - Error logging and monitoring
